📸 HOW TO ADD YOUR PHOTOS 📸
============================

FOR THE PHOTO GALLERY:
----------------------
1. Put your couple photos in this folder
2. Name them simply like: photo1.jpg, photo2.jpg, etc.
3. Open config.js and add the filenames to the photos section:

   photos: {
     enabled: true,
     folder: "photos/",
     images: [
       "photo1.jpg",
       "photo2.jpg",
       "our-date.png"
     ],
     captions: [
       "Our first date 💕",
       "Beach day 🏖️",
       "Forever together ❤️"
     ]
   }


FOR THE "TRY AGAIN" IMAGE (when she clicks No):
-----------------------------------------------
1. Add an image named "tryagain.png" to this folder
2. This will pop up whenever she clicks the No button!
3. Make it funny or cute 😄


💡 TIPS:
- Supported formats: JPG, PNG, GIF, WEBP
- Square or landscape photos work best
- Keep file sizes reasonable for fast loading
- Captions are optional but sweet!
